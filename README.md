# No Man's Planet
**aka No Man's Sky in Windows console**

Hi, NMP is a game of approximation with No Man's Sky mechanics. You know, there is a cosmos, spaceship, planets, procedural terrain generation (no miracles, the only thing you'll ever encounter on the planets is the dirt and sometimes a base).
<br>**Game in not finished** and I will not finish it..

So, enjoy with this tech demo!
